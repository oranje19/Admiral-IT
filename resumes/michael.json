        "summary": "My name is Michael, and the revolutionary world of coding is something I am really passionate about. Solving algorithms on Leetcode is exciting, and I enjoy the challenge of solving bugs and problems in the code I write. I graduated from Stanislaus State University with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science, and have experience using Jira’s Kanban board from a math beta testing position I had with Get More Math. Some of the languages and tools I have recently used include JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, React, Redux, CSS3, and Git.",
